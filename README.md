# ImageProcessing-CMP3108M
Assignment for Image Processing module


This was a simple assignment to use MatLab to demonstraight image processing techniques. 
The bonus section was to identify all of the starfish in the input image.

When creating the routine that identified the starfish in one image I tried to demonstraight my understanding of the algorithms involved my using as few in-built functions as possible.  The sollution therefor is probably slightly less efficiant than using in-built and runs significantly slower as I wanted to print the results of each step in the routine.
